The subdirectories contain examples of how `DBT-2
<https://github.com/osdldbt/dbt2>`_ can be used.

See the DBT-2 documentation for further test kit setup that will be required.

The following is list of subdirectories and a brief description of the scenarios
they are benchmarking.  There is an additional README in each directory that
describes each scenario further:

`dbcon-scaling` - Determine throughput scalability when increasing the number
of database connections.

`warehouse-scaling` - Determine throughput scalability when increasing the
size of the database.
